    <p>An AI personal assistant who listens to what you said and makes memos
      to remind you. Ideal to anyone who manages anything.</p>
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>When I was managing a software startup, I gave so many instructions
      to various teams on different subjects every day that I often forgot
      what I had said by the next day. I asked for an assistant to write down
      everything I said, but of course, I was turned down. Now, thanks to
      OpenAI, I can have a loyal assistant at minimal cost. Bounny will listen
      to everything you say and create memos to remind you.</p>
    <p>There are two types of summaries available. The default option is a
      checklist aimed at business people, while the other is a regular
      summary. Both types of summaries are editable and can be translated into
      other languages.</p>
    <p>The app is specifically designed to recognize the speech of an
      individual, rather than recording or transcribing conference
      discussions. It is recommended to use the app with earphones for the
      best experience.</p>
